- .netlify directory: This directory is created when creating a netlify project by default
- netlifyTS directory: This directory has my endpoint functions written in typescript
- netlify directory: This directory has a functions directory which contains all my functions/endpoints written in javascript. This is the file that is running on netlify
- src: This directory contains: 
  - enums directory which only has Role type functions
  - users directory which has a User class and my endpoints testing file
- dist: This directory has all my typescript files compiled/converted to javascript
